##long running experiments

  Saves each session into the experiments directory
	Sample structure:	
	

	/experiments
		/march_23-Results
			params.log
			test.log
			train.log
			model.net
			top_model.net

   - top_model.net is the neural network that achieved the best accuracy that session  
   - note that you still must manually specify how many epochs each session should run for, otherwise it will go forever
