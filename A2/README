The two execution scripts are designed to be run on HPC. The only things that should be changed if not running on HPC are where torch is located and where the data is located. These can be easily changed in both 'execute' and 'testModel'

TO TRAIN MODEL AND TEST:
export HERE=$PWD
./execute
On HPC
qsub execute -v HERE=$PWD

TO TEST MODEL
export HERE=$PWD
./testModel
On HPC:
qsub testModel -v HERE=$PWD

Note: these scripts must be in the same folder as the .lua files and the model being used (the latter only applies to testModel)
